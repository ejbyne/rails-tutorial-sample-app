# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Twitter Clone

## Summary

This is the tutorial contained in [Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

The tutorial contains a detailed introduction to using Ruby on Rails, with a step by step guide to creating a professional grade "Twitter clone" sample application. Topics covered include:

- Integrating Bootstrap/SASS
- Layouts and partials
- Correctly structuring an application with routes and MVC
- Database migrations and integrating the database with ActiveRecord
- Security: password encryption, validation
- Account activation and password reset emails
- Sessions and cookies in Rails
- Database associations: creating followers and followed users
- Creating a status feed showing followed users' microposts
- Image upload
- Using the Rails MiniTest testing framework

This was a comprehensive tutorial, which really deepened my understanding of how Rails works under the surface. For example, in previous applications I had used the Devise gem, which provides a ready-made user authentication solution. This tutorial on the other explains how to create a professional user authentication system step by step, including setting up password encryption/validation and sessions/cookies.
